                     One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams,
                     he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
                     vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted
                     his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
                     domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The
                     bedding was hardly.
